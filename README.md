# multiple perceptron network
"Multi-Layer" (2) perceptron network expanding upon single perceptron implementation.


A single perceptron can only learn simple patterns (Linearly separable - See 1) (like AND or OR).

By combining the outputs of multiple perceptrons you are able to solve more complex problems (XOR).

We train one perceptron to learn the OR function
We train another perceptron to learn the AND function
We can then compute XOR using these two outputs










1 - A problem is linearly separable when you can draw a single straight line (or plane in higher dimensions) that completely separates the different classes of data points.
